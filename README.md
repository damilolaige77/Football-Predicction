This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the top 4 teams in Europeâ€™s top 5 football leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1) for the current season. The model is built on historical data from the past 10 seasons, including team performance metrics, player statistics, and other relevant features.

A machine learning ensemble approach is used, combining Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bagging, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to improve predictive accuracy. The ensemble method is designed to enhance model stability and performance by aggregating the strengths of individual algorithms.

Key highlights of the project include:

Data Processing: Cleaning and preprocessing raw match and performance data.
Feature Engineering: Crafting meaningful features from 10 years of football data.
Modeling: Implementing and tuning multiple machine learning models.
Ensemble Learning: Combining models to create a robust prediction engine.
Performance Evaluation: Using cross-validation and metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to assess model performance.
This project provides a powerful framework for forecasting top team performances, with potential applications in sports analytics, betting markets, and football management.
